(Web-Dev) Change 'Create New' Link

We want to make the 'Create New' link into a clickable Font Awesome icon.  
Change the page title from 'Index' to 'Production Photos' and place the icon to the right of the page title.  
Use Font Awesome's fa-plus-circle icon for the button.  
The circle portion of the icon should be red and the plus portion of the icon should be white
