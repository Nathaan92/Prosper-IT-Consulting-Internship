CRUD Pages & Functionality for Subscription Plans

There are currently no way to change or add Subscription Plans without going through code.  
Scaffold a Subscription Plan Controller and View pages (Index, Create, Details, Update, Delete).  
Visual Studio should automatically create the CRUD methods but there is some more logic that should be 
incorporated into the Create and Edit method.  Before being able to Create or Edit a new Subscription Plan, 
check all Subscription Plans in the database to see if that Subscription Plan has same SubscriptionLevel, 
PricePerYear, or NumberOfShows as any of the other Subscription Plans.  If so, use a model state error and present 
error text to the user ("There is already a plan that offers a price/year of [[[PricePerYear]]]", 
"There is already a Plan that offers [[[NumberOfShows]]] free shows", "There is already a plan with that Subscription Level
 [[[SubscriptionLevel]]]").
