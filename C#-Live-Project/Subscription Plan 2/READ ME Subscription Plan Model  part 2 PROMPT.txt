Subscription Plan Model | part 2

To test out the new SubscriptionPlan Model, on the Subscriber Dashboard, change the "Current Subscription Level: Silver" 
text to dynamically change based on the Subscriber's Subscription Level.  
Use Razor to make the Subscription Level text under the "Manage Your Subscription" area dynamic.

The Subscriber User that is being created in the createRolesandUsers seed method should also be initialized with a 
SubscriptionPlan object ("Gold").
