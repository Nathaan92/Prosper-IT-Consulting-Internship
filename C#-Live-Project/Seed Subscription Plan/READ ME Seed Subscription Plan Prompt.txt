Seed Subscription Plans

Recent students created a new Model called SubscriptionPlans.  
This Model represents a payment plan that a User can subscribe to to become a Subscriber.  
Create a new seed method in the Startup.cs file and populate it with 3 Subscriber Plans:

Subscription Level | PricePerYear | NumberOfShows
-------------------------------
1. "Platinum" | $500 | 100
2. "Gold" | $300 | 10
3. "Silver" | $200 | 5

Additionally, change the seeded Subscriber User.  
Currently, a new SubscriptionPlan is created when the Subscriber User is created.  
Instead of creating a brand new SubscriptionPlan, the Subscriber should be assigned an already existing plan.

There is a dropdown and an Update Subscription button at the bottom of the Subscriber Dashboard page.  
This button is meant to update the Subscription Level of the Signed in Subscriber.  
There was a SubscriptionPlan object created to represent the three different tiers that we have: Platinum, Gold, Silver.

Make the Update Subscription button disabled unless the selected plan in the dropdown doesn't match their current Plan.  
In other words, the Update Subscription button should visually change and be clickable if the Subscriber tries to change 
their plan.

Clicking the Update Subscription button should update the Subscriber to that SubscriptionPlan.
