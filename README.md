# Prosper-IT-Consulting-Internship
During my internship I had participated in 3 sprints over 6 weeks, working with teams ranging from 4 members to just myself. This experience taught me first hand how to employ the methodologies of agile and scrum all while working remotely.

The first was a two week sprint in which I used Django frame work to build a webapp. The purpose of this app was to collect user information on preferences collected from search and survey results to provide them suggestions on what kind of hikes they would be interested in. I utilized Python for the logic of the program and used CSS and HTML for the construction of the UI.

The second was a four week sprint in which I completed stories for an already developed MVC webpage. This was a particularly fun experience for me in which I not only debugged, developed more striking UI, created another aspect of the webpage but I also delve into a dynamic team environment where we worked on rather complex and new issues. I particularly enjoyed this portion of the experience and found that MVC is a framework that I am comfortable with.
